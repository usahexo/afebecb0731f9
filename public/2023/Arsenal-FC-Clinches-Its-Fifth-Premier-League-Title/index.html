With two games still to play, the team has now put some much-needed distance between themselves and second-placed Manchester City.</p>
<p>What has made this championship so sweet for the Gunners is that it was secured in such convincing fashion. Not only are they currently ten points clear of their nearest rivals, but they’ve also scored more goals and conceded fewer than anyone else in the division.</p>
<p>Most of the credit for this astonishing turnaround must go down to manager Arsène Wenger. The Frenchman has been with Arsenal since 1996, and he’s now in his twentieth year at the club. It’s fair to say that some of the doubters have been silenced this season, with Wenger finally managing to win a Premier League title without having to rely on expensive signings.</p>
<p>Instead, he’s based his success on a combination of young homegrown players and experienced veterans like Laurent Koscielny and Petr Čech. There have been a few bumps in the road – most notably the 6-0 thrashing at Chelsea in March – but by and large Wenger’s tactics have paid off.</p>
<p>Not only is this title a personal vindication for Wenger, but it’s also an important victory for Arsenal Football Club as a whole. The club had gone through a difficult period in the late 2000s and early 2010s, with fans often protesting against the owner, Stan Kroenke, and calling for Wenger’s resignation.</p>
<p>But with this new Premier League trophy in their cabinet, things are looking up for Arsenal FC once again. The team can now look forward to playing in next season’s Champions League, and there’s no doubt that they’ll be among the favourites to win it all.</p>
<h1 id="What-a-Great-Season-for-Arsenal-FC"><a href="#What-a-Great-Season-for-Arsenal-FC" class="headerlink" title="What a Great Season for Arsenal FC!"></a>What a Great Season for Arsenal FC!</h1><p>Arsenal FC capped off a great season with a 3-1 victory over Chelsea in the FA Cup Final. The victory was especially sweet for the Gunners, who had not won the tournament since 2005.</p>
<p>The FA Cup final was also a chance for Arsenal to exorcise some demons. The Gunners had lost their last three meetings with Chelsea, including a demoralizing 5-1 defeat in their previous encounter.</p>
<p>But Arsenal were firing on all cylinders against Chelsea on Saturday. The Gunners got off to a quick start, taking a 2-0 lead into halftime. Goals by Alexis Sanchez and Aaron Ramsey gave Arsenal a commanding lead heading into the break.</p>
<p>Chelsea pulled one back in the second half, but an Olivier Giroud goal sealed the victory for Arsenal. It was an emotional moment for Giroud, who had been relegated to the bench earlier in the season but worked his way back into the starting lineup and played a major role in Arsenal’s FA Cup campaign.</p>
<p>The victory over Chelsea was just the latest highlight in an excellent season for Arsenal. The Gunners finished in fifth place in the Premier League table, missing out on Champions League qualification by just one point. But Arsenal still had something to play for in the final weeks of the season, as they battled Tottenham Hotspur for third place and automatic qualification for the Champions League.</p>
<p>Arsenal eventually clinched third place with a 4-0 win over Watford in their final league match of the season. That win ensured that Arsene Wenger would finish his 22-year tenure at Arsenal with at least one trophy – making it an appropriate farewell for one of English football’s most successful managers.</p>
<p>The cup final victory over Chelsea was just another feather in Wenger’s cap as he prepares to leave Arsenal this summer. But he will be leaving behind a squad that is capable of great things – as evidenced by their performances this season.</p>
<p>With Alexis Sanchez set to leave (or be sold) and several other players set to come into the squad, there is plenty of reason for optimism among Arsenal fans as they look ahead to next season.</p>
<h1 id="Poker-Prodigy-Mesut-Ozil-Leads-Gunners-to-Victory"><a href="#Poker-Prodigy-Mesut-Ozil-Leads-Gunners-to-Victory" class="headerlink" title="Poker Prodigy Mesut Ozil Leads Gunners to Victory"></a>Poker Prodigy Mesut Ozil Leads Gunners to Victory</h1><p>Mesut Ozil is a German professional footballer who plays for Arsenal in the Premier League and the Germany national team. He is widely considered to be one of the best players in the world.</p>
<p>Ozil started his club career at hometown club Schalke 04, where he made his Bundesliga debut in 2005. In 2010, he moved to La Liga club Real Madrid, with whom he won the Spanish Cup in 2011 and became a three-time champion of the UEFA Champions League in 2014, 2016 and 2017. Ozil transferred to Arsenal in 2013 for a then club-record £42.5 million.</p>
<p>Ozil’s performances for Germany have earned him 92 caps and resulted in winning the Silver Boot at the 2010 FIFA World Cup as well as being named Mannschaft captain for UEFA Euro 2016. After helping Germany to reach the semi-finals of UEFA Euro 2016, Ozil was awarded the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany by President Joachim Gauck.</p>
<p>Arsenal</p>
<p>2013–present: Ozil made his debut for Arsenal against Sunderland on 18 September 2013. He assisted Olivier Giroud’s opening goal in a 2–1 win at the Stadium of Light. On 1 November 2013, Ozil scored his first goal for Arsenal against Marseille in a 2–0 win at the Emirates Stadium in the group stage of the Champions League; it was also his first goal in European competition since his Real Madrid goals against Ajax during their run to the Champions League title in May 2014.</p>
<p>On 3 December 2013, Ozil nominated former Gunner Thierry Henry as his “ idol “ on Instagram . Three days later, he provided two assists for Giroud and Aaron Ramsey ‘s goals as Arsenal crushed Newcastle United 6–3 at St James’ Park . On 22 March 2014, Ozil assisted Laurent Koscielny ‘s equaliser before scoring an 89th-minute winner—his fourth goal for Arsenal—in a 2–1 victory over Everton .[101] On 14 April 2014, he played all 90 minutes as Arsenal reached their first FA Cup final in nine years with a 3–0 win over Wigan Athletic at Wembley Stadium .[102] Ahead of the final, Ozil was awarded with the PFA Fans’ Player of the Year award.[103] On 17 May 2014, he started in FA Cup final as Arsenal lost 3–2 to Hull City after extra time .[104][105]<br>In late August 2014, Ozil missed two games due to injury and missed a third through illness; upon returning to full training he was criticized by manager Arsène Wenger for appearing “ out of shape “. Wenger said that Ozil needed to work harder mentally and physically , adding “At 22 you can get away with it but not at 26”.[108] After coming on as a second-half substitute for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain , Ozil scored his first competitive goal of the season – from 25 yards – as Arsenal beat Galatasaray 4–1 on aggregate en route to reaching the group stage of Champions League . In November 2014, Ozil pledged £50,000 (€70K)to help rebuild Engelsberg Sportpark , which had been damaged by fire earlier that year.[110]<br>On 18 January 2015, an unmarked Ozil opened a slender 1–0 victory over Newcastle United at St James’ Park with his 10th goal of the season ; this was also Newcastle’s first home loss under new manager Steve McClaren .[111] An injury suffered while playing against Chelsea kept Ozil out until 5 April,[112] although he returned two weeks ahead of schedule after taking injections.[113] He then played 72 minutes against West Ham United on 12 April before being substituted early due to hamstring tightness ;[114][115] Arsène Wenger stated that it was only a minor problem and that Ozil would “ be available next week “,[116][117] but he missed matches against Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United due to health reasons.[118][119] In late May 2015, Mesut Özil sparked controversy when he announced via Facebook that he would no longer be playing for Germany national team due to racism allegations following Die Mannschaft’s shock World Cup exit .</p>
<h1 id="Arsenal’s-Strong-Poker-Play-Earns-Them-a-Victory"><a href="#Arsenal’s-Strong-Poker-Play-Earns-Them-a-Victory" class="headerlink" title="Arsenal’s Strong Poker Play Earns Them a Victory"></a>Arsenal’s Strong Poker Play Earns Them a Victory</h1><p>The teams took the field Wednesday night in an English Premier League soccer match. The stakes were high, as each team sought to improve its standings.</p>
<p>Arsenal, sporting its characteristic red jerseys, came out strong, pressing the offensive and forcing several turnovers. Midfielder Granit Xhaka was a standout player for Arsenal in the first half, threading some beautiful passes through the defense.</p>
<p>The opposing team, Tottenham Hotspur, worked hard to keep up and managed to get a few shots on goal, but their efforts were stymied by Arsenal’s goalkeeper Petr Cech.</p>
<p>At halftime, the score stood at 0-0.</p>
<p>Both teams emerged from the break determined to take the lead. Arsenal again applied pressure and kept Spurs off balance with some well-placed shots.</p>
<p>Finally, in the 68th minute, midfielder Aaron Ramsey scored a goal that would give Arsenal the victory. The crowd erupted in joy as the final minutes of the match ticked away.</p>
<p>The win puts Arsenal into second place in the Premier League table, just two points behind Chelsea. It was a well-earned victory for Arsène Wenger’s team and proves that they are still a force to be reckoned with this season.</p>
<h1 id="Ozil-and-Arsenal-Continue-Their-Dominance-in-Poker-and-Football"><a href="#Ozil-and-Arsenal-Continue-Their-Dominance-in-Poker-and-Football" class="headerlink" title="Ozil and Arsenal Continue Their Dominance in Poker and Football"></a>Ozil and Arsenal Continue Their Dominance in Poker and Football</h1><p>Arsenal midfielder Mesut Ozil was in top form last night, helping the Gunners to a 5-1 victory over Everton while also putting on a clinic in poker at the same time. Ozil has now put together an impressive streak of performances in both poker and football, further cementing his place as one of the elite players in both sports.</p>
<p>Ever since joining Arsenal from Real Madrid in 2013, Ozil has been one of the standout players in the Premier League. He has displayed an uncanny ability to create chances for teammates and score goals himself, helping Arsenal to three FA Cup titles in four seasons. Ozil’s exploits on the football pitch have not gone unnoticed in the poker world either, with the German having won two World Series of Poker (WSOP) bracelets and over $5 million in prize money.</p>
<p>Ozil’s latest victory came last night against Everton, where he helped Arsenal open up a 5-0 lead before halftime. The German midfielder was involved in all five goals, scoring one and setting up four others. This impressive performance was further highlighted by his exceptional play at the poker table, where he finished as runner-up in two separate tournaments.</p>
<p>In the $1,000 No Limit Hold’em event, Ozil narrowly missed out on first place after losing a heads-up battle against American pro Christian Pham. The German then made it all the way to heads-up again in the $10,000 No Limit Hold’em Six Max event, but this time he was unable to get past Greek pro Antonis Angelou camponios. Despite these two second-place finishes, Ozil still managed to finish Day 2 of both tournaments as chip leader.</p>
<p>With his excellent performance last night, Ozil has shown that he is still one of the best players in the world regardless of whether he is playing football or poker. This latest victory will only serve to increase his confidence ahead of this year’s World Cup, where he will be looking to help Germany win their fourth title.</p>
