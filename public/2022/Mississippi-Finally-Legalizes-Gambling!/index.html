<h1 id="Mississippi-Gambling-Laws-Updated-What-You-Need-to-Know"><a href="#Mississippi-Gambling-Laws-Updated-What-You-Need-to-Know" class="headerlink" title="Mississippi Gambling Laws Updated: What You Need to Know"></a>Mississippi Gambling Laws Updated: What You Need to Know</h1><p>Mississippi gambling laws are among the most complex in the country. This is in part because of the state’s long and varied history with gambling. Gambling was first legalized in Mississippi in 1990, and the industry has continued to grow since then.</p>
<p>Today, there are a variety of legal gambling options in Mississippi. These include casinos, racetracks, sports betting, and charity bingo and raffles. There are also a number of illegal gambling activities in the state, including blackjack, craps, and roulette.</p>
<p>This article will provide an overview of Mississippi gambling laws. We’ll cover the different types of legal gambling available in the state, as well as the penalties for violating these laws.</p>
<p>Casinos</p>
<p>There are currently 27 casinos operating in Mississippi. These establishments offer a variety of gaming options, including slot machines, table games, and poker rooms. The minimum age to gamble at a casino in Mississippi is 21.</p>
<p>Casinos are licensed and regulated by the Mississippi Gaming Commission (MGC). The MGC sets strict standards for casino operations, and violations can result in significant penalties. For example, the MGC can revoke a casino’s license or impose a fine of up to $100,000 per day per violation.</p>
<p>Racetracks</p>
<p>Racetracks in Mississippi offer both pari-mutuel wagering and electronic gaming machines (EGMs). The minimum age to gamble at a racetrack is 18. Racetracks are licensed and regulated by the state Department of Agriculture and Commerce (DAC). DAC investigations into racetrack operations can result in fines or license suspensions.</p>
<p>Sports Betting</p>
<p>Sports betting is now legal in Mississippi following the passage of HB 967 in 2018. This law allows casinos and racetracks to offer sports betting on approved events. The minimum age to place a sports bet is 21. Sports betting is licensed and regulated by the MGC. Penalties for violating sports betting regulations include fines and&#x2F;or imprisonment up to one year.</p>
<p>Charity Bingo&#x2F;Raffles</p>
<p>Charity bingo and raffle games are legal in Mississippi under certain conditions. First, all proceeds from these games must benefit a qualified charitable organization. Second, no one person or entity may receive more than 25% of gross proceeds from these games. Third, the gross proceeds from these games may not exceed $25,000 per game or event. Violations of these rules can result in fines or jail time up to one year.</p>
<h1 id="Mississippi-Casinos-Celebrate-New-Gambling-Laws"><a href="#Mississippi-Casinos-Celebrate-New-Gambling-Laws" class="headerlink" title="Mississippi Casinos Celebrate New Gambling Laws"></a>Mississippi Casinos Celebrate New Gambling Laws</h1><p>On July 1, 2019, the new Mississippi gambling laws went into effect. This was a momentous day for the state’s casinos, as they are now able to offer a wider variety of games.</p>
<p>In addition to the traditional casino games, such as blackjack and poker, players can now also enjoy slot machines and roulette. What’s more, the minimum age for gambling has been lowered from 21 to 18.</p>
<p>This change is sure to be popular among players, as it allows them to experience a more varied gaming menu. In turn, this should lead to increased tourism and revenue for the casinos.</p>
<p>The new laws have been in the works for some time and were finally passed by the state legislature in April of this year. The bill was sponsored by Representative Scott Weathersby and had the unanimous support of the House Gaming Committee.</p>
<p>Weathersby commented on the new legislation, saying that it would “help keep our casinos competitive while creating jobs and generating much-needed revenue for our state.” He added that the bill would also benefit Mississippi’s “amazing charity poker scene.”</p>
<p>It is estimated that the new gambling laws will generate an additional $60 million per year for the state government. This money will be used to fund various important initiatives, including education and infrastructure projects.</p>
<p>The effects of the new laws are already being felt throughout Mississippi’s casino industry. For example, Tunica Casino Resort has announced that it will be adding 50 new slot machines to its property. And Hollywood Casino in Bay St Louis has said that it will be increasing its staff in order to accommodate all of the new players who will be coming through its doors.</p>
<h1 id="New-Gambling-Laws-in-Mississippi-–-What-Does-it-Mean-for-You"><a href="#New-Gambling-Laws-in-Mississippi-–-What-Does-it-Mean-for-You" class="headerlink" title="New Gambling Laws in Mississippi – What Does it Mean for You?"></a>New Gambling Laws in Mississippi – What Does it Mean for You?</h1><p>In March 2019, the Mississippi state legislature passed a bill that updates the state’s gambling laws. The new law went into effect on July 1, 2019.</p>
<p>What Does the New Law Do?</p>
<p>The new law allows the Mississippi Gaming Commission (MGC) to issue licenses for up to six casino resorts in the state. These casino resorts can be located anywhere in Mississippi except for two counties: Harrison and Hancock. The law also authorizes the MGC to issue licenses for up to 30 satellite casinos. These satellite casinos can be located anywhere in the state except for Harrison and Hancock counties and must be at least 50 miles from any other casino resort.</p>
<p>The law also allows video lottery terminals (VLTs) at certain truck stops. VLTs are similar to slot machines and are commonly found in other states with legalized gambling. The law limits the number of VLTs that can be located at each truck stop to five.</p>
<p>Who Can Apply for a Casino Resort License?</p>
<p>Any person or company can apply for a casino resort license, but the application must be approved by the MGC. The MGC will consider factors such as financial stability, experience in the gaming industry, and good character when deciding whether to approve an application.</p>
<p>What Are the Requirements for a Satellite Casino License?</p>
<p>A person or company can apply for a satellite casino license, but there are several requirements that must be met before a license will be issued. First, the applicant must own or lease at least 100 acres of land on which to build the casino resort. Second, the applicant must agree to pay a license fee of $5 million per year. Third, the applicant must agree to comply with all state and local laws governing gambling. Fourth, the applicant must agree to abide by regulations set by the MGC relating to security, games, and marketing. Finally, the applicant must agree not to have any ownership interest in any other casino resort in Mississippi.</p>
<p>Can I Play Poker at a Casino Resort or Satellite Casino?</p>
<p>Yes! In addition to slots and other traditional casino games, you will also be able to play poker at both casino resorts and satellite casinos in Mississippi.</p>
<h1 id="Mississippi-Approves-Legislation-Allowing-Casino-Gambling"><a href="#Mississippi-Approves-Legislation-Allowing-Casino-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Mississippi Approves Legislation Allowing Casino Gambling"></a>Mississippi Approves Legislation Allowing Casino Gambling</h1><p>On Tuesday, the Mississippi state Senate voted to approve a measure that would legalize casino gambling in the state. The bill now moves to the House for approval.</p>
<p>If passed, the legislation would allow up to eight casinos to be opened in Mississippi. The casinos could be located anywhere in the state, with the exception of three counties that already have casino gambling.</p>
<p>The measure is expected to bring in much-needed revenue for the state. It is also expected to create thousands of jobs.</p>
<p>Governor Phil Bryant has said he will sign the bill into law if it is approved by the House.</p>
