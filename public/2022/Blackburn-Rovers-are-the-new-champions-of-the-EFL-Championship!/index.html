        <h1 id="Blackburn-Rovers-are-the-new-champions-of-the-EFL-Championship"><a href="#Blackburn-Rovers-are-the-new-champions-of-the-EFL-Championship" class="headerlink" title="Blackburn Rovers are the new champions of the EFL Championship!"></a>Blackburn Rovers are the new champions of the EFL Championship!</h1><p>With the title now mathematically secure after a 3-1 victory against Nottingham Forest on Saturday, Blackburn have completed their remarkable turnaround following their relegation from the Premier League in 2015.</p>
<p>Manager Tony Mowbray has led Rovers back to the top flight as champions, with captain Charlie Mulgrew lifting the trophy at Ewood Park amid scenes of jubilation.</p>
<p>“What a feeling!” Mulgrew told Sky Sports. “It’s been a real team effort - the boys have been fantastic all season.</p>
<p>“We knew it was going to be tough at the start but we’ve dug in and got the result we needed today. It’s an amazing achievement.”</p>
<p>Blackburn were 10 points adrift of second-placed Fulham with just six games to play, but they finished the season on a run of seven consecutive wins to seal their return to the Premier League.</p>
<h1 id="Norwich-City-shock-favourites-Middlesbrough-to-win-the-title"><a href="#Norwich-City-shock-favourites-Middlesbrough-to-win-the-title" class="headerlink" title="Norwich City shock favourites Middlesbrough to win the title!"></a>Norwich City shock favourites Middlesbrough to win the title!</h1><p>Norwich City were 15&#x2F;2 outsiders with bookmakers to win the Premier League title at the start of the season, but they have shocked everyone by taking an early lead at the top of the table.</p>
<p>Their victory over Middlesbrough on Sunday was their sixth in a row, and they are now favourites to lift the trophy at the end of the season.</p>
<p>Since being promoted to the top flight in 2011, Norwich have finished in 11th, 12th and 14th place, so this is a real surprise.</p>
<p>However, they have been playing some excellent football so far this season, and they arguably deserved to beat Manchester City in their last match.</p>
<p>Alex Pritchard has been particularly impressive, with four goals and two assists already this season, and he will be looking to continue his good form against Bournemouth on Saturday.</p>
<p>If Norwich can maintain their current form, they could well be Premier League champions come May.</p>
<h1 id="Brighton-amp-Hove-Albion-finish-top-of-the-table-to-secure-promotion-to-the-Premier-League"><a href="#Brighton-amp-Hove-Albion-finish-top-of-the-table-to-secure-promotion-to-the-Premier-League" class="headerlink" title="Brighton &amp; Hove Albion finish top of the table to secure promotion to the Premier League!"></a>Brighton &amp; Hove Albion finish top of the table to secure promotion to the Premier League!</h1><p>Brighton &amp; Hove Albion have secured promotion to the Premier League following their 1-0 victory over Wigan Athletic on Saturday.</p>
<p>The Seagulls needed just a point to be sure of their place in the top flight, and they duly delivered with a hard-fought win at the DW Stadium.</p>
<p>Pascal Gross’ early goal was enough to seal all three points for Chris Hughton’s side, and they will now join Newcastle United and Brighton in next season’s Premier League.</p>
<p>It is a remarkable achievement for Brighton, who were in danger of relegation just a few months ago.</p>
<p>But they have now won 10 of their last 12 games to finish top of the table, and there is no doubt that they belong in the Premier League.</p>
<p>Their players and fans will be relishing the challenge of competing against England’s best teams next season, and it should be an exciting campaign ahead for Brighton &amp; Hove Albion.</p>
<h1 id="Newcastle-United-amp-Reading-relegated-from-the-EFL-Championship-despite-final-day-drama"><a href="#Newcastle-United-amp-Reading-relegated-from-the-EFL-Championship-despite-final-day-drama" class="headerlink" title="Newcastle United &amp; Reading relegated from the EFL Championship despite final day drama!"></a>Newcastle United &amp; Reading relegated from the EFL Championship despite final day drama!</h1><p>Both Newcastle United and Reading were relegated from the EFL Championship on the final day of the season, despite last-gasp goals from both clubs.</p>
<p>The Magpies looked certain to stay up heading into their match against Barnsley, but they conceded two stoppage-time goals to lose 2-1 and send themselves down.</p>
<p>Reading had a better chance of survival, but they also went down after throwing away a 1-0 lead in their clash with Nottingham Forest.</p>
<p>It means that Fulham and Cardiff City will be playing in the Championship next season, while Huddersfield Town and Brighton &amp; Hove Albion join them in the Premier League.</p>
<h1 id="Fulham-crowned-winners-of-the-London-Premier-League-with-Brentford-and-QPR-close-behind"><a href="#Fulham-crowned-winners-of-the-London-Premier-League-with-Brentford-and-QPR-close-behind" class="headerlink" title="Fulham crowned winners of the London Premier League, with Brentford and QPR close behind"></a>Fulham crowned winners of the London Premier League, with Brentford and QPR close behind</h1><p>Fulham have been crowned the winners of the London Premier League, with Brentford and QPR close behind. This is only Fulham’s second season in the league, and they have managed to achieve a very successful campaign, topping the table with 83 points.</p>
<p>Brentford finished in second place, with 82 points, while QPR finished in third place with 79 points. These three teams were well clear of the rest of the pack, with fourth-place Chelsea finishing on 59 points.</p>
<p>The battle for relegation was waged between four teams, with Reading, Bolton Wanderers, Birmingham City and Hull City all fighting to avoid relegation. In the end, it was Reading who suffered relegation, finishing in 18th place with just 33 points.</p>
<p>Bolton Wanderers finished in 17th place with 36 points, Birmingham City finished in 16th place with 38 points and Hull City finished in 15th place with 40 points. This means that all four of these teams will be playing in League One next season.</p>
