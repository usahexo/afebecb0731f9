Online casino players who like to use their portable devices to make payments will be happy to know that they can use their smartphones or tablets to make secure payments at their favourite online casinos.

There are a number of different ways that you can make payments using your portable device, and the most popular method is by using a mobile banking app. Most mobile banking apps allow you to make secure payments by scanning a QR code or by entering a payment amount and account number.

Another popular method for making payments using your portable device is by using an e-wallet. E-wallets are popular because they allow you to store multiple payment methods in one place, such as credit cards and bank accounts. This makes it easy for you to pay for purchases online without having to enter your payment information each time.

Another benefit of using an e-wallet is that many of them offer security features such as two-factor authentication and fraud protection. This means that you can be confident that your payment information is safe when you use an e-wallet to make a payment online.

If you would like to use your portable device to make a payment at an online casino, then we recommend using one of the following methods:

-Scan a QR code with your smartphone or tablet
-Enter a payment amount and account number into a mobile banking app
