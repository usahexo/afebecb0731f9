There are many ways to write a 1000 words article. In this tutorial, we will show you two methods: the first one is to write about a topic of your choice, and the second one is to write about a recent news story.

Writing about a Topic of Your Choice

When choosing a topic, make sure that you are interested in it and that you have enough information to write about. Here are some tips for choosing a topic:

-Choose a topic that you know well. This will make writing the article easier because you won't have to do as much research.
-Do some research on your topic. This will help you learn more about it and ensure that your article is accurate.
-Choose a topic that is timely or controversial. Writing about something that is in the news or that people are talking about will generate more interest in your article.

Once you have chosen a topic, it's time to start writing! The first step is to come up with a thesis statement-a sentence that states your position on the topic. Then, use evidence from your research to support your thesis statement. Finally, wrap up your article by restating your thesis statement and giving your opinion on the topic.

Here is an example of an article that was written about a topic of choice:

The Pros and Cons of Homeschooling

Homeschooling has become an increasingly popular option for parents in recent years. There are many reasons why parents might choose to homeschool their children, such as to give them more individualized attention or to teach them religious values. But what are the pros and cons of homeschooling? Here is a look at some of the pros and cons of homeschooling:

PROS:
-Homeschooled children can get more individualized attention than they would in public school. -Children can learn at their own pace and may be able to move ahead faster or slower than their peers in public school. -Homeschooled children can be taught religious values or any other type of values they may not learn in public school. -Homeschooled children can have more exposure to different types of learning opportunities, such as field trips and internships. 
-Homeschooling can save parents money because they don't have to pay for tuition like they would if their children were enrolled in private school or public school. 
CONS:
-Homeschooled children may miss out on important socialization opportunities with their peers.  -Children who are homeschooled may feel isolated from the rest of society and find it difficult to transition into mainstream society when they reach adulthood.  -There is less oversight with homeschooling than there is with traditional schooling, so parents need to be responsible for making sure their children are getting an adequate education
