#  Manchester United Eyeing Top Spot in EFL Championship

Manchester United are eyeing a return to the Premier League at the first time of asking, as they currently lead the race for the EFL Championship title.

The Red Devils have enjoyed a superb season under new manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and currently sit nine points clear at the top of the table with just 10 games remaining.

United’s squad appears to be far too strong for the Championship and they are likely to secure an immediate return to the top flight.

The likes of Paul Pogba, Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial have all impressed for United this season, with Solskjaer’s side scoring plenty of goals in the process.

It would be a major shock if Manchester United were unable to win promotion back to the Premier League this season, and they will be confident of achieving their goal.

#  EFL Championship Table: Who's Hot and Who's Not

The English Football League Championship table is heating up as we near the end of the season. There are a few teams who are looking like they're going to make it to the Premier League, while others are fighting for their lives to stay in the division.

Let's take a look at which teams are doing well and which ones need to step it up.

[Hot Teams](#hot-teams)

1. Wolverhampton Wanderers – The Wolves have been on fire this season, thanks in part to their new manager, Nuno Espirito Santo. They currently sit in first place in the table and look poised to win promotion to the Premier League.

2. Cardiff City – Another team that's been doing well lately is Cardiff City. They've managed to stay near the top of the table all season and seem destined for a spot in the Premier League next year.

3. Fulham – Fulham has also had a strong season and currently sits in third place in the table. They've been one of the most exciting teams to watch this year and should be commended for their stellar play.

[Not So Hot Teams](#not-so-hot-teams)

1. Ipswich Town – Ipswich has not had a good season by any means. They currently sit at the bottom of the table and look likely to be relegated down to League One next year.

2. Bolton Wanderers – Bolton is another team that's in danger of being relegated this year. They currently sit in 18th place in the table and don't appear to be improving anytime soon.

3. Sunderland – Finally, Sunderland is another team that's having a tough time this season. They sit at second from bottom in the table and look like they're headed for relegation back down to League One

#  Brighton & Hove Albion on the Rise in EFL Championship

Brighton & Hove Albion are a team on the rise in the English Football League (EFL) Championship. The club, which is located in Brighton, England, finished its 2017-2018 season in fifth place in the championship league table. This placed the team just outside of the promotion playoff spots and marked an improvement from its 2016-2017 season finish of twelfth place.

Brighton’s resurgence can be largely attributed to two things: new manager Chris Hughton and record signing striker Glenn Murray. Hughton was appointed as Brighton’s new manager in December 2014, and he has helped lead the club to better league performances each season. Murray, who signed with Brighton from AFC Bournemouth in January 2017, has been stellar for the club, scoring 30 goals in 73 appearances across all competitions over the past two seasons.

Looking ahead to the 2018-2019 season, Brighton & Hove Albion will be looking to make a run for promotion into the Premier League. The club has already made some significant offseason moves, highlighted by the signing of Dutch midfielder Davy Propper from PSV Eindhoven for a club-record fee of £10 million. With Hughton at the helm and players like Murray and Propper leading the way, there is no doubt that Brighton will be one of the teams to watch in this year’s EFL Championship.

#  Stoke City Struggling in EFL Championship

Stoke City have had a difficult season in the EFL Championship, as they sit in 16th place in the table. The club has been unable to establish any consistency this season, and they have only won six matches out of their 23 fixtures.

One of the main reasons for Stoke’s poor form has been their lack of goals scored. The club has only found the back of the net 26 times this season, which is the fourth-worst tally in the league. This is a major concern for manager Gary Rowett, who will be looking to address this issue in the January transfer window.

Another issue that Rowett will need to address is Stoke’s defence. The club has conceded 49 goals this season, which is the fourth-worst total in the division. This means that they have been conceding an average of 2.1 goals per game, which is not good enough for a team looking to secure promotion back to the Premier League.

The Potters do have some talented players in their squad, and they will be hoping that they can start performing better in order to achieve their objectives for the season. Players such as Joe Allen, Jack Butland and Xherdan Shaqiri will need to step up and lead by example if Stoke are going to make a late push for promotion.

It has been a disappointing season for Stoke City so far, but there is still time for them to turn things around. Manager Gary Rowett will need to work on fixing the team’s defensive problems, and he will also need to find a way to score more goals. If he can do that, then there is no reason why Stoke can’t achieve promotion back to the Premier League.

#  Swansea City Hoping for Promotion to the Premier League

Swansea City are a Welsh football club that play in the Premier League. The club is from Swansea in the Glamorgan area of Wales. The club was founded in 1912 and played their first competitive match in 1921.

The club has had mixed fortunes over the years with spells in both the top flight and lower leagues of English football. However, they have been ever-present in the Premier League since 2011.

The 2017-2018 season was their 7th consecutive season in the Premier League and they finished in 10th place. This season, they will be hoping to improve on that position and challenge for a place in the top 6 or 7 which would lead to qualification for European football.

The manager of Swansea City is Graham Potter who was appointed at the start of the 2018-2019 season. He is a former player with over 200 appearances for clubs such as Birmingham City, West Bromwich Albion and Stoke City. As a manager, he has previously held roles at Swedish sides Östersunds FK and Ostersunds DFF, as well as English side Brighton & Hove Albion.

Potter has made a positive impact at Swansea City so far, with the team playing an attractive brand of passing football. The Swans currently sit 17th in the Premier League table but there is plenty of time left in the season for them to make a push up the table.

Key players for Swansea City this season include midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson and striker Wilfried Bony. Sigurdsson was Swansea’s top scorer last season with 11 goals and he will be looking to add to that tally this season. Bony rejoined Swansea from Manchester City during the summer transfer window and he will be looking to recapture his best form after scoring 34 goals in 76 appearances for Swansea during his first spell at the club.
