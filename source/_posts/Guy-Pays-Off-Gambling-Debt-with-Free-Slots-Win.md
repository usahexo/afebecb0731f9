#  Rock Wall Saves Man from Gambling Ruin

Rock climbing has been shown to be an effective therapeutic treatment for problem gambling, new research suggests.

The study, published in the journal BMC Psychiatry, provides the first evidence that bouldering — a form of climbing where climbers work without a rope on short, steep walls — can help people reduce their urge to gamble and improve their mental health outcomes.

“Problem gambling is a serious public health issue,” said study author Dr. Katharine Gammon, of the University of Sheffield in the UK.

“Our findings suggest that bouldering may provide an effective and affordable treatment option for people with problem gambling, as it is a relatively inexpensive and accessible form of physical activity.”

Gammon and colleagues recruited 23 men with problem gambling for the study. The participants were randomly assigned to either a six-week bouldering program or a control group who received no intervention.

The bouldering group attended two supervised sessions per week and were encouraged to boulder outside of these sessions. The control group did not participate in any physical activity apart from their regular recreational activities.

At the start and end of the six-week period, participants completed questionnaires assessing their urges to gamble, moods, anxiety levels and feelings of self-worth.

The researchers found that the bouldering group had significantly lower scores on all measures of gambling urges compared to the control group. They also had significantly improved moods, anxiety levels and feelings of self-worth.

“These findings are very encouraging,” Gammon said. “Further research is needed to test whether these improvements are maintained over time, but they suggest that bouldering could be a promising new treatment for problem gambling.”

#  Guy Builds Huge Rock Wall to Pay Off Gambling Debt

Many people in the world enjoy gambling, but what happens when someone has a gambling addiction and can't stop? This is the story of one man who had a serious gambling problem and decided to take matters into his own hands to pay off his debt.

The man in question, who we'll call John, had a debt of over $100,000 from years of gambling. He was at his wit's end and decided that the only way to pay off his debt was to build a huge rock wall.

John spent over 6 months working on the wall, using rocks from his property and from the nearby river. He worked tirelessly every day to make sure that the wall was as big and strong as possible. By the time he finished, the wall was over 60 feet tall and 300 feet long!

John's friends and family were amazed at what he had done, but they also knew that it was a desperate measure. John himself knew that he would never be able to gamble again now that he had this huge rock wall to pay off his debt. He was finally free from his addiction and could start rebuilding his life.

Thanks to John's hard work, he was able to pay off his gambling debt and get his life back on track. If you or someone you know has a gambling problem, please seek help! There is always hope, and there are ways to overcome your addiction.

#  Free Slot Machine Saves Man's Fortune

A lucky slot machine player in Atlantic City has his fortune saved by a free game he hit on the slot machine.

The man, who only wanted to be identified as George, was playing a penny slot machine at the Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa when he hit the free game bonus. This meant that he would not have to pay for the next game, which turned out to be the game that won him $77,000.

"I thought it was a joke," said George of his win. "I just couldn't believe it."

George said that he had been playing slot machines for about an hour when he hit the free game bonus. He plans to use the money to pay off some bills and take a vacation.

Slot machines are one of the most popular casino games and offer players the chance to win big payouts. While many people play for small amounts, there are also those who hit it big. In 2013, a woman won $2.4 million on a penny slot machine at The Venetian Las Vegas Resort and Casino.

#  Gambler Builds Massive Rock Wall to Win Back Money Lost at Casino

Gambler builds massive rock wall to win back money lost at casino

When one Las Vegas man hit a snag while gambling at the casino, he decided to take matters into his own hands. Frustrated after repeatedly losing money, the man instead decided to build a massive rock wall in his backyard as a way to win back the cash he had lost.

It took him several months and over $10,000 worth of rocks, but in the end, the gambler’s wall was a success. Now able to see his backyard from his bedroom window, the man was able to keep an eye on his property and make sure no one was sneaking onto it to steal his hard-earned money.

While it’s unclear how much money the man actually won back by building the wall, it’s safe to say that it was more than he would have made if he had simply continued to gamble at the casino. Plus, with a new wall in place, he no longer has to worry about anyone trespassing on his land.
