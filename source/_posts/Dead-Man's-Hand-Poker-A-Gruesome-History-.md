#  Dead Man's Hand Poker: A Gruesome History 

The history of Dead Man's Hand, a poker game variation, is gruesome but fascinating. The game is said to have been invented by poker player and outlaw Jesse James.

Legend has it that James created the game as a way to make quick money from unsuspecting suckers. The basic principle is that the player holds two pair – two aces and two eights – which is also known as the dead man's hand. This gives the player a significant advantage over their opponents.

The story goes that James was playing a game of poker with some friends one night when he was shot in the back by Robert Ford, who was hoping to claim the bounty on James' head. As James lay dying on the floor, he revealed his winning hand – two pairs of aces and eights – and thus Dead Man's Hand was born.

While there is no concrete evidence to support this story, the legend of Dead Man's Hand has captured people's imaginations for generations. The game remains popular to this day and can be found in many online and land-based casinos.

#  What is Dead Man's Hand in Poker? 
In poker, "Dead Man's Hand" refers to a hand made up of two pairs: Aces and Eights. The name most likely comes from the fact that this hand was reputedly held by Wild Bill Hickok when he was killed.

The hand is not particularly strong, and is only rarely played in modern poker. In fact, some players believe that holding any two pairs is actually playing with dead man's hand. Nevertheless, the name has remained popular over the years, and the hand continues to be mentioned in popular culture.

#  Who Invented Dead Man's Hand in Poker? 

The game of poker can be traced back to the 16th century when it was played in France as poque. The game migrated to America with the settlers and quickly became popular. In the early days of poker, there were many variations of the game. One of these variants was called dead man's hand. 

There is no one definitive answer to who invented dead man's hand. There are several candidates that have been proposed over the years. Some sources say that it was a gambler named James Butler who first came up with the hand. Others claim that it was Calamity Jane who invented it. Still others believe that it was Jesse James who made the hand famous. 

There is no concrete evidence to support any of these claims. However, most experts agree that it is likely one of these people who invented the hand.

#  Playing Dead Man's Hand Poker 

Poker is a popular card game that involves betting and bluffing. There are many variants of poker, but the most common version is Texas Hold'em. In this article, we will discuss the basics of playing Dead Man's Hand Poker.

Dead Man's Hand Poker is a variant of poker that is based on the old Wild West outlaws, Jesse James and John Wesley Hardin. The game was created by Bruce Corman and was first played in 2006.

The game is played with a regular deck of 52 cards. The goal of the game is to win all of the chips from the other players. The game can be played with 2 to 8 players, but it works best with 4-6 players.

The dealer deals 5 cards to each player, face down. The player to the dealers left starts the betting round by either folding, calling or raising. The player to the dealers right then has the same options. This continues until all of the players have either folded or put in money equal to the current bet.

The dealer then flips over the first card in the deck, which is called the "flop". This card will be used in conjunction with the player's hand to create a five-card poker hand. The second card is flipped over and this is called the "turn". The third card is flipped over and this is called the "river".

The players then reveal their cards and compare hands. The highest hand wins all of the chips from the other players. If there is a tie, then each player splits the pot equally.

#  The History of the Dead Man's Hand in Poker

The dead man's hand is a poker hand consisting of two pairs, aces and eights. The hand gets its name from the legend of Wild Bill Hickok, who was killed while playing poker in 1876.

There are several different stories about how the dead man's hand got its name. One story is that Hickok was playing poker in Deadwood, South Dakota, when he was killed by Jack McCall. McCall supposedly said "Damn, I've killed my best friend" after he shot Hickok.

Another story is that Hickok was playing poker in Colorado when he was killed. One of his opponents, Charlie Utter, allegedly said "Bill has finally drawn dead".

The most likely explanation is that the name originated from a combination of different stories. The ace and eight cards were often called the "dead man's hand" because they were often held by men who had died in gunfights.
