#  Minnesota Vikings Look to Add Blackjack to their Casino Gambling Arsenal

The Minnesota Vikings have been one of the most successful teams in the NFL over the past few years, reaching the playoffs multiple times. With that level of success comes a desire by the team to increase its revenue streams, and it is believed that adding blackjack to their casino gambling arsenal can help them do just that.

There are already a number of states where NFL teams offer blackjack as part of their casino gambling offerings, and it is likely that the Vikings will follow suit if they can get the appropriate approvals from state regulators. The team is said to be in discussions with several casinos about offering blackjack at their venues, and if all goes well,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) players could be betting on blackjack sides and propositions at some of Minnesota’s casinos before the end of the year.

One potential issue for the Vikings is that there are already a number of other major sports teams in Minnesota that offer blackjack as part of their casino gambling options. This could limit the amount of business that the team can generate from this activity, but it is still seen as a potentially lucrative stream of revenue.

The Vikings are not alone in their interest in expanding into casino gambling; almost all NFL teams now have some sort of relationship with casinos. This is due in part to new legislation passed in 2015 which allows teams to own casinos outright, and it has led to a massive expansion in this area. In addition to blackjack, teams are now offering slots, poker, and other casino games, and they are seeing significant profits from these activities.

It remains to be seen whether or not the Vikings will be able to add blackjack to their casino gambling offerings, but if they are successful, it could provide a significant boost to their bottom line.

#  Minnesota Vikings to Offer Blackjack Tables at their Stadium for Home Games

The Minnesota Vikings announced that they will offer blackjack tables at their stadium for all home games this season. The Vikings organization believes that this new amenity will help increase ticket sales and create a more fun and exciting game-day experience for their fans.

The blackjack tables will be set up in the stadium's concourse, and fans will be able to play for real money or for free. The Vikings have hired professional dealers to run the tables, and they will be open from one hour before kickoff until the end of the game.

Vikings CEO Rick Spielman said that the team is "excited to add this new amenity to our stadium." He added that "blackjack is a popular casino game that many of our fans are familiar with, and we think it will add a lot of fun and excitement to our games."

The Vikings are not the first NFL team to offer blackjack tables at their stadium. The Dallas Cowboys, Oakland Raiders, and San Francisco 49ers all offer blackjack games at their venues.
