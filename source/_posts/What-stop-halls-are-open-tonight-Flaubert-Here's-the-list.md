#  Flaubert stop halls are now open!

Flaubert stop halls are now open for the Fall semester. You can find the building on your right when you exit the library. It is a new, three-story building that will house our business and computer science programs. The first floor will have classrooms, administrative offices, and laboratories. The second and third floors will have classrooms and laboratories.

This is an exciting addition to our campus and I know that our students will benefit from the state-of-the-art facilities that this new building offers. I encourage you to take a tour of the Flaubert stop hall and see for yourself how impressive it is.

Thank you for your continued support of our college.

The Line 9 has 17 stops, but only 12 of them are open at night time while the last stop (Mairie d’Issy) is closed around 1:00am every day except Friday and Saturday nights when it closes at 3:00am. The Lines 10, 11, and 12 each have only one stop that is open late into the evening hours (except on Sundays when these lines close earlier). These three lines converge to form a loop around central Paris known as the “Grande Ceinture” or “Great Belt”.

The Lines 13, 14, 15, and 16 all have several stations that remain open late into the evening hours (usually until about 1:00am). However, there are a few exceptions: for example, on Saturdays the last train on the Line 13 leaves Gare Saint-Lazare station at 2:00am instead of 1:00am like it does during the weekdays.
