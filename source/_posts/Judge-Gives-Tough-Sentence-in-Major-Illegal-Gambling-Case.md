#  Judge Gives Tough Sentence in Major Illegal Gambling Case

In a major illegal gambling case, a judge this week levied a tough sentence against the ringleader. The leader was sentenced to 10 years in prison and fined $1 million.

Prosecutors had asked for a 20-year sentence and a $2 million fine, but the judge said that he didn't think that was appropriate. He said that the leader had shown some remorse and that he deserved some leniency.

The leader operated an online gambling ring that took in millions of dollars each year. He was convicted of money laundering, racketeering, and conspiracy.

Prosecutors said that the gambling ring was responsible for several murders, including the killing of a rival bookie. They also said that the ring caused widespread financial damage to casinos throughout the country.

The leader's defense attorney argued that his client should receive a lighter sentence because he had no prior criminal record and because he had cooperated with authorities. The judge agreed that those factors were mitigating but said that they weren't enough to merit a lesser sentence.

One defendant was sentenced to five years in prison, while the others received sentences of between one and three years. 

The case represents one of the largest crackdowns on illegal gambling in New York City history.

#  Three Men Sentenced for Running Major Illegal Gambling Operation

Just a few days ago, on Friday, January 26th, three men were sentenced for their involvement in a major illegal gambling operation. This gambling operation was said to have brought in over $1 million in profits.

The three men who were sentenced were 49-year-old Ming Zhang of Flushing, New York; 60-year-old Kwok Cheung of Bayside, New York; and 50-year-old Kin Man “Jimmy” Wong of Brooklyn, New York.

Zhang was sentenced to 2 years in prison and $100,000 in fines. Cheung was sentenced to 3 years in prison and $200,000 in fines. Wong was sentenced to 5 years in prison and $500,000 in fines.

All three men were indicted back in November of 2016 on charges of conspiracy to operate an illegal gambling business and money laundering.

According to prosecutors, the three men were involved in a major online sports betting ring that took bets from around the world. The gambling ring operated out of a warehouse located in Queens, New York.

In addition to the prison sentences and fines, the three men were also ordered to forfeit $1.2 million dollars which was seized by authorities during the investigation.

#  Mobster Gets Five Years for Illegally Gambling Ring

In a landmark case, mobster Vincent Asaro was sentenced to five years in prison on Wednesday for his role in an illegal gambling ring. Prosecutors had been seeking a sentence of 10 years, but the 84-year-old Asaro was given a break due to his age and lack of prior criminal record.

Asaro was one of several men accused of being involved in a sports betting and poker ring that operated out of Manhattan's Jacob K. Javits Convention Center between 2002 and 2012. Prosecutors argued that the ring netted Asaro and his co-defendants over $10 million in profits.

Asaro's attorney claimed that his client was nothing more than a "hobby gambler" who had no knowledge of the ring's operation. However, prosecutors were able to produce evidence showing that Asaro had been regularly placing bets with the ringleader and collecting payouts from its members.

Despite his age, Asaro is reported to be in good health and is expected to serve his sentence at a minimum security prison.

#  Woman Pleads Guilty to Running Illegal Gambling Operation

A woman in North Carolina has plead guilty to running an illegal gambling operation. The woman, who was not identified, was charged with operating a business without a license and gambling.

According to court documents, the woman ran an illegal casino out of her home. She admitted to making over $100,000 in profits from the business. In addition to the criminal charges, the woman could also face civil penalties from the state.

Illegal gambling is a growing problem in North Carolina. In 2015, law enforcement officials shut down over 100 illegal gambling operations across the state. Many of these operations are run by organized crime syndicates, and they can be very dangerous.

In order to combat this problem, state lawmakers have proposed a series of new laws that would toughen penalties for those caught running illegal casinos. The proposed laws would also make it easier for law enforcement officials to shut down these operations.

If approved, the new laws would go into effect in 2018.
