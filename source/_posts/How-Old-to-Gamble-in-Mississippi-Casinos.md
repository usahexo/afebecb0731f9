#  What is the Minimum Age to Gamble in a Mississippi Casino?

Gambling has been around in some form or another for centuries, and while the minimum age to gamble in a casino may vary by location, it is typically 18. Mississippi is no different, as it sets the minimum gambling age at 21.

This applies to all types of gambling, whether it’s playing the slots, betting on horses, or playing poker. This is also true for both land-based casinos and riverboats.

There are some exceptions to this rule, however. If you are younger than 21 but are accompanied by an adult who is 21 or older, you are allowed to gamble. And if you are a member of the military and are 18 or older, you are allowed to gamble in Mississippi casinos.

So why is the minimum age to gamble in a Mississippi casino set at 21? The simple answer is that this is the age at which a person is considered to be an adult in the eyes of the law. And as with most laws, there is usually more than one reason behind it.

One reason for setting the minimum age at 21 is that it allows casinos to verify that players are of legal age. This helps ensure that minors aren’t able to gamble, which can potentially lead to problems such as addiction. It also prevents casinos from being liable if something goes wrong with regards to minors gambling.

Another reason for setting the minimum age at 21 has to do with protecting those who may be too young or inexperienced to make sound decisions when it comes to gambling. Gambling can be addictive, and it can be easy for someone who is under 21 years old to get caught up in it and end up losing a lot of money. By setting the minimum age at 21, lawmakers hope to protect people from making bad decisions that could have negative consequences down the road.
