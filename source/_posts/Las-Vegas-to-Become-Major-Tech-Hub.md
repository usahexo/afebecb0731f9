#  Las Vegas to Become Major Tech Hub

Las Vegas is set to become a major tech hub in the near future, with plans for a massive new development that will convert the city into a leading center for innovation.

The project is being spearheaded by Switch, a technology company that is investing $5 billion in the redevelopment. The goal is to create an environment where businesses can collaborate and innovate, with the hope of driving economic growth.

"We're creating an ecosystem," said Switch CEO Rob Roy. "A place where entrepreneurs can start their businesses, where they can learn from each other, and where they can grow."

The centerpiece of the project will be a new 500-acre campus that will include office space, incubators, and labs. There will also be retail and residential areas, as well as a hotel and conference center.

The project is expected to create thousands of jobs and attract major companies to Las Vegas. It's also hoped that it will help stimulate the local economy and generate new investment in the city.

"This is a game changer for Las Vegas," said Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval. "It's going to create jobs and attract top talent to our state."

The Switch development is just one example of how Las Vegas is evolving into a leading tech center. Other initiatives include Zappos' downtown headquarters and the recent opening of the city's first technology incubator, called The Mill.

With its low cost of living, warm weather, and growing tech sector, Las Vegas is quickly becoming a prime destination for business owners and entrepreneurs.

#  Las Vegas to Become Solar Energy Leader

Nevada’s Clark County, which is home to the city of Las Vegas, has announced plans to become the largest solar-energy producer in the United States.

The county has entered an agreement with Nevada Clean Energy (NCE), a utility company, to build a 350-megawatt solar farm. The project will be the largest in the world, and is expected to create up to 6,000 jobs.

Construction on the solar farm is set to begin in 2019, and it will be fully operational by 2021. The plant will produce enough energy to power more than 115,000 homes.

“This is a transformational project for our community and dramatically underscores Nevada’s commitment to becoming one of the most important renewable energy states in America,” said Clark County Commissioner Steve Sisolak.

NCE is also planning to build two smaller solar farms in Las Vegas. Combined, these three projects will have a generating capacity of 525 megawatts – enough to power more than 175,000 homes.

#  Las Vegas to Host World's Largest Electric Car Show

The Electric Vehicle Association (EVA) has announced that the world's largest electric car show will take place in Las Vegas in May 2019. The three-day event will include a range of activities for electric car enthusiasts, from test drives and car shows to panel discussions and workshops.

Electric cars are becoming increasingly popular, with sales growing by 24% worldwide in 2017. This growth is being driven by a number of factors, including emissions regulations, improvements in technology and falling prices. As a result, the electric car market is expected to reach $2 trillion by 2030.

Las Vegas was chosen as the host city for the electric car show due to its growing role in the electric vehicle market. The city is home to a number of major automotive companies, as well as one of the largest EV charging networks in the world. In addition, Nevada has some of the most favourable policies for EVs in the United States, with tax breaks and no emissions testing required.

The Electric Vehicle Association (EVA) was founded in 2017 with the aim of promoting electric vehicles and helping to accelerate their adoption. The organisation has over 100,000 members from around the world and organises events such as this electric car show to promote awareness and understanding of electric vehicles.

#  New Las Vegas Airport to Open in 2022

Las Vegas is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world, and its airport is consistently ranked among the busiest in the United States. The current airport, McCarran International Airport, was built in 1948 and has been unable to keep up with the city's growing demand. A new, state-of-the-art airport is scheduled to open in 2022, just in time for the city's centennial celebration.

The new airport will be located on a plot of land about 15 miles south of the current airport. It will have four runways and enough passenger capacity to accommodate up to 100 million passengers per year. This would make it one of the busiest airports in the world, surpassing Beijing Capital International Airport.

The new Las Vegas airport has been in the works for many years, but it has faced several delays due to funding issues. In 2017, however, the Nevada state legislature approved a bill that provided $1.9 billion for construction of the new airport. This allowed work on the project to finally get underway.

The first phase of construction is expected to be completed by 2021, and the entire project is scheduled to be finished by 2022. The new airport will include a terminal building, a concourse, a parking garage, and other amenities. It will also have an Advanced Rapid Transit system that will connect it with downtown Las Vegas and other parts of the city.

Las Vegas is a major economic engine for Nevada and its construction will create thousands of jobs. The new airport is expected to spur significant growth in tourism and other sectors of the economy. It will also help reduce traffic congestion at McCarran International Airport.

So far, there has been no announcement about which airline will be operating at the new Las Vegas Airport. However, McCarran International Airport is currently operated by six airlines: American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines, Spirit Airlines, United Airlines, and Volaris Mexico. It is likely that at least some of these airlines will move to the new airport when it opens in 2022.
