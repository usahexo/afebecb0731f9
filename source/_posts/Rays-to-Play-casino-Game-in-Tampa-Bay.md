#  casino game helps you root for the Rays

The casino game “Beat the dealer” can be a fun way to pass the time – and to root for your favorite team at the same time

In this game, you are trying to beat the dealer by getting as close to 21 as possible, without going over. The dealer is playing against you both, so you are competing against each other.

If you are a Rays fan, you can use this game to help cheer them on. Try to get as close to 21 as possible each time you play. When the Rays win, you can celebrate by cashing in your winnings!

If you are new to “Beat the Dealer”, here are some tips to help you get started:

1. Don’t go over 21. This is the number that will cause you to lose the game.

2. Remember that the dealer also has a chance of winning. So don’t get too confident – especially if the dealer has a strong hand.

3. Use your cards wisely. If you have two low cards, try not to hit again (unless there are only low cards left in the deck). This will increase your chances of going over 21.

4. Keep track of how many cards remain in the deck. This will help you make decisions about whether or not to hit or stand.
